## Course Description

This course focuses on computational models for inference within the field of natural language processing. We will cover both fundamental research and applications. Students will be exposed to existing benchmarks and their limitations, solved and unsolved problems, active research areas and research opportunities, state-of-the-art solutions applying machine learning techniques, and evaluation strategies. The format of this course is unusual. It emphasizes reading and understanding research papers, writing and presentation skills, and a large research project. Successful projects will result in a paper that could be submitted to a peer-reviewed venue.
